# ✉️ Healthcare Management & Appointment System  
The application was built with a strong focus on usability, role separation, and real-time data management. It reflects how modern healthcare platforms operate, where multiple user roles interact with shared data while having different permissions and responsibilities.   

The system supports: <br>
🙋‍♀️ Patients  <br>
🧑‍⚕️ Doctors <br>
👨‍💻 Admins <br> 

The frontend is implemented in React, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface. Firebase is used as the backend infrastructure, handling authentication, database storage, and real-time data synchronization.
